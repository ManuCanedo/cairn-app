## Why Archived?

These documents were created during the foundation phase and are now superseded by:

- `docs/DEV_TASKS.md` - Source of truth for task specifications
- `docs/PROJECT.md` - Current architecture and tech stack
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` - Active development guidelines

## Can I Still Use These?

Yes! These documents contain valuable historical context:

- Understanding past architectural decisions
- Reviewing how tasks were originally scoped
- Learning from the foundation review process

They should not be used for:

- Current implementation guidance
- Up-to-date task specifications
- Active development workflows
